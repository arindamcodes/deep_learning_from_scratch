# deep_learning_from_scratch
Implementing different NN structures from scratch in torch to understand everything from ground level

1. Character level LM with basic RNN from scratch
2. Encoder-Decoder based Neural Machine Translation with GRU from scratch
3. Attention based neural machine translation with GRU from scratch (This example is replication of Andrew Ng's Sequence model lab but implemented in more depth using torch)
